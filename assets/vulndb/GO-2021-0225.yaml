description: |
    Certain invalid inputs to ReadUvarint or ReadVarint could cause those
    functions to read an unlimited number of bytes from the ByteReader argument
    before returning an error. This could lead to processing more input than
    expected when the caller is reading directly from a network and depends on
    ReadUvarint and ReadVarint only consuming a small, bounded number of bytes,
    even from invalid inputs.

    With the update, ReadUvarint and ReadVarint now always return after consuming
    a bounded number of bytes (specifically, MaxVarintLen64, which is 10). The
    result being returned has not changed; the functions merely detect and return
    some errors without reading as much input.
