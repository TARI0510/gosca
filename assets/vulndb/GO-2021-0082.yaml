description: |
    Thirft Servers preallocate memory for the declared size of messages before
    checking the actual size of the message. This allows a malicious user to
    send messages that declare that they are significantly larger than they
    actually are, allowing them to force the server to allocate significant
    amounts of memory. This can be used as a denial of service vector.
