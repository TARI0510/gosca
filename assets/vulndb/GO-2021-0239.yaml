description: |
    The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr
    functions and their respective methods on the Resolver type may
    return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS which do not follow
    the established RFC 1035 rules for domain names. If these names
    are used without further sanitization, for instance unsafely
    included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected
    content. Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values
    that could require sanitization before further use.
