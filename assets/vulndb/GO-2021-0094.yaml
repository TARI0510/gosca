description: |
    Protections against directory traversal during archive extraction can be
    bypassed by chaining multiple symbolic links within the archive. This allows
    a malicious attacker to cause files to be created outside of the target
    directory. Additionally if the attacker is able to read extracted files
    they may create symbolic links to arbitrary files on the system which the
    unpacker has permissions to read.
